    thinking: "Bizzy is thinking about your question...",
    bankVsCU: "Great question! Here's the simple difference:\n\nüè¢ Banks are like big stores - they have lots of locations and services, but they're trying to make money from you.\n\nü§ù Credit Unions are like community groups - they're owned by people like you, so they usually have better deals and care more about helping you.\n\nFor people just starting with banking, credit unions are often better because they have lower fees and more patient, helpful staff.",
    recommendation: "Based on what you told me, I think a credit union would be perfect for you. They'll take time to explain things and help you succeed.",
